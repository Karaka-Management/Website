    frontend developers or developers working on the core application.</p>
<p>The guide is not explaining in detail how to use classes, for this you can find the automatically generated code

    are mandatory. Not following these guides can cause security issues, worsen the user experience or even cause
    malfunction as well as make it difficult for other developers to understand the code.</p>
