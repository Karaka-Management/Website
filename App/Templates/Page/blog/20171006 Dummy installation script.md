# Dummy installation script

The installation of the pre-alpha version should be done via the unit tests. They generate dummy data which also help to test the UI. In the future however the installation will be done through a web installation form. A very first draft of the installation form is now online and can be found [here](http://oms.orange-management.de/Install).

The idea is to only let the user or admin make minimum configurations during the installation. The main configuration such as localization, user permissions, module installation etc. should be done in the backend after installation. This will make the installation process very painless and fast. The user will not be forced to familiarize himself with a form he will most likely not use for a long time after installation and can focus on getting to know the actual backend. 

The layout will be very minimalistic with a nice slide animation when going through the installation process.
