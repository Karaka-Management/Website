# Developer Website Component Added

Today I found some time to make a lot of changes in the `Build` system. I completely restructured the repository and also adjusted some scripts. Now whenever the `./inspection.sh` script is run it automatically creates a new live demo, performs inspections on the source code and also performs unit tests. If you would like to see which inspections are performed please feel free to check them out [here](http://website.orange-management.de/dev). 

Tools I'm using currently are PHPUnit, pdepend, phpmetrics, phploc, phpcpd, as well as some custom shell scripts. In the future I also plan to implement code style validation for a uniform coding style as well as the javascript unit tests which I have to implement yet. Additionaly I also hope to setup the automatic framework documentation generator in the coming days as well.

The full build and inspection scripts can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/Orange-Management/Build).
