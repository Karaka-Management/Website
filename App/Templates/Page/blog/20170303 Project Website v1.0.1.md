# Project Website v1.0.1

Today I released the new project page which still needs a lot of work but is a first step to the right direction. This layout will most likely not be the final version but it still looks and feels much better than the old desing. This implementation also allows me to test the automatic integration of module and application documentation for the future offical product website.

The goal of this project page is to provide a first basic understanding about the project for early followers. Updated documentation in the git repositories will be included automatically and new modules will also get included automatically by scanning available modules. The blog will allow me to write down some of my thoughts which are not necessarily meant for github issues or a wiki page. The dev area will keep track of current development activities, framework documentation and unit tests.

The website uses the `phpOMS` Framework as well as `Parsedown` for parsing markdown files. In the future I hope to replace Parsedown with my own markdown parser.
