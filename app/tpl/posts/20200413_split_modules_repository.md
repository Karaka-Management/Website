# Split Modules Repository

All modules are now separate in their own repository. This will allow us to better handle updates to the different modules, assign issues and tasks in a more verbose way and most importantly we will be able to implement an update system based on repository version bumps. Additional advantages will be that we can automatically build module update packages in the future or fork single repositories for customer customizations.
