# Code Style Checks and Static Code Analysis for the Test Report Generator

The newest update of the test report generator brings a couple new features which should be helpful for various use cases.

Earlier we just mentioned that we are doing code style checks and static code analysis for our code but never included these information in the report. With the new update this is now improved and you can find these information included as well.

Additionally, every test suite now also includes a summary of the test results. Before you had to manually check how many tests passed for a test suite but with the change you can find a table at the top of every test suite including similar information as in the overview.
