# New Backend Design

The new draft backend design is implemented and follows a much simpler, less dominant and much cleaner color guideline. In addition to the new design we also implemented some basic hotkeys for easier page navigation.

| Element           | Hotkey             | Action                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Global            | Ctrl + P           | Jump to search bar                                  |
| Global            | Ctrl + Right Arrow | Jump to next UI element                             |
| Global            | Ctrl + Left Arrow  | Jump to previous UI element                         |
| Global            | Ctrl + B           | Go to previous page (back)                          |
| Link or Tab       | Enter              | Activate/execute/follow link                        |
