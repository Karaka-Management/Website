# Update TODO file

The `TODO` file got a major update in terms of structure and content. We tried to move as many todos from the code comments into the TODO file as reasonably possibly. There are probably still some todos left which can and should be moved to the TODO file but many of the remaining todos at this point in time make more sense in the source files where they are easier to understand because of the context.

In the TODO file you can see the subjective difficulty which is hinted by `[easy]`, `[medium]`, `[hard]`. Issues/todos with the `[hard]` tag should most likely not be touched from external software developers since they often require design decisions which the core development team should make. In the future we may add `[core]` as a tag in order to specify which issues should only be solved by the core development team.
