# RFC: Union Types

We started with implementing the union types according to the rfc https://wiki.php.net/rfc/union_types_v2. The use case for the union types is extensive and will have a lot of application. It remains to be seen in which situations it should be really used (also in view of performance impact) or the old mixed docblock type hints should remain.
