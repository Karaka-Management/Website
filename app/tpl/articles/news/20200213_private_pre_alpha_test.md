# Private Pre-Alpha Test

I'm happy to announce that it's finally time to start some production tests, albeit these tests are only for very limited functionality and modules. In the next couple of days the application including the core modules, `Media` module and `Helper` module will get installed on the servers of a company for some live tests.

* In a first step this company will use the application in order to show and export reports of existing data in a foreign database for business purposes (e.g. sales reports, income statement etc.).
* In a second step the group, account, permission and organization management will get tested.
* In a third step the editor, news and task modules will be implemented and tested.
* The last step of this first private pre-alpha test will include the email, messaging and calendar implementation and test.

It's possible that also some other modules will be tested and developed on the side depending on the result (e.g. human resource time recording, human resource management, wiki, Q&A, ...).
