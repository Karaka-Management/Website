# The New Website [Draft]

Our new website layout is now online and contains information about the services and solutions we will offer in the future.

We decided to go with a purple color schema which provides nice contrast to the Karaka logo coloring and individually structured pages for the specific content we want to show on that page.

## Urls

Our pages and different services are available from the following urls:

| URL                                                                | Type         |
