# New Demo Setup

With the new demo setup script we create a more realistic demo application compared to the demo which was crated as part of the testing process. The new demo setup script allows us to create specific scenarios and data setups without corrupting them or overshadowing them with other data from other tests.

The demo setup will be expanded whenever we implement new functionality in existing modules or create new modules. This is also great for developers to test the module and its integration in a more realistic scenario. The amount of data which can be simulated in a reasonable time is of course limited but we try to at least randomly/semi-randomly generate a reasonably sized data amount.

The first benefits for us as developers were already a much faster development process because of this implementation since we can test and actually see realistic data in a much easier way than previously. We aim to upload this new demo in the next couple of days so that you can also get a better feeling about the status of the application.
