# Login Screen

The new login screen design is drafted and partially implemented. The new design uses much more similar color schema as the website. In the future the whole website design will follow the same color schema. The implementation process will be done over the course of multiple month.

The next design steps are:

* Clean up the login template and styles and potentially move them to the global css styles.
* Implement the global layout for the backend
* Pick module-by-module and create high quality designs like it was done for the login template

The goal is to have a representable frontend UI where test users can already get a first impression of the high quality and easy to use interfaces for the final release.
