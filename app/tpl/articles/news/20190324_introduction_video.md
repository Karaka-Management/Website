# Introduction Video & Patreon

The introduction video for the Karaka project got created and uploaded to youtube. The next episodes will focus on development aspects in order to provide sufficient information for potential new contributors and interested people in general.

Topics which are covered in this video are:

* What is Karaka?
* What is the goal of the project?
* How do we believe to be able to achieve these goals?
* What is the current status of the project?
* Future episodes

The introduction video also got added to our newly created patreon page which you can find at: https://www.patreon.com/orange_management or use the donate button at the bottom of the page.

For the patreon page we intend to add merchandise at a later time once the beta version or first release candidate is released. If you want to support us feel free to do so we are happy about every contribution.
